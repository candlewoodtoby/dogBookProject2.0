# My dogBook - WDI Project #2

Technologies Used:
My dogBook is a web application written with Ruby on Rails. It uses a PostgreSQL database and a Cloudinary API for image processing and content delivery/storage.
This application allows dog owners to create a profile page for their dog(s) and upload photos
to create a photo gallery. All dog owners can see other dog owners, dog profiles and associated photo
galleries.

Approach Taken:
I started developing this application with a wireframe concept as a directional guide on how I wanted
the app to look and operate upon completion. I focused the early stages on setting up the application's
framework for signing up users, log-in/log-out, RESTful routes for my resources. I then focused the latter
stages of development developing the applications ORM models and associations between dog owners, dogs, and
photos. The resulting version completed as of Fri, Jul 31, 2015 has been pushed up to Heroku for deployment.

Unsolved Problems:
I did not have the time to incorporate a search feature so that registered users could search the database
for certain dogs based on dog attributes such as breed, size, location etc or other dog owners.
I also did not have the time to incorporate a ranking feature allowing dog owners to vote favorites
for dogs they see on the site. I also did not have the time to place walls between users who enter the app
as they have the ability to add dogs or photos of other users instead of being denied access.
